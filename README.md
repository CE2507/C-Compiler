**Overview**
  
  If your not sure where to start I reccomend looking at Lexical-Analysis file for a start





**For DFA Notes**
  
  I would reccomend reading "What is DFA" Than "Conversions" and finally "Regex to NFA ex." after that
  starting with the NFA conversions going to the NFA to DFA example and the DFA conversions is how it is meant to be read

**Note**

  comment regex are not included I encourage you to try it for yourself I havent decided yet weather Im going to add them to the
  final DFA implementation
